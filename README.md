# About the project
The Karma – is a blockchain-based charity foundation platform implemented on the top of Hyperledger Fabric. The Karma
platform allows charitable organizations and funds to create and manage different philanthropic projects, accept
donations, and present the auditable public trail of all transactions and other activities.

The Karma is developed for fundraising in a trustful environment. The blockchain network consists of reliable, publicly
known organizations with impeccable reputations. Such blockchain features as non-repudiation, immutability, and
provenance guarantee the transparency of all operations of the organizations within the network. Thus, the Karma
platform can help build trust by preventing the consequences of dishonest actions and identifying the activities of
fraudulent organizations.

While the Karma platform can help build trust and increase transparency for charity organizations, it does not intend
to replace the traditional fundraising channels. However, implementation of new technology and innovation, with the
increase in transparency, can attract new donors who, due to personal reasons, do not trust the existing ways of
collecting donations.

## Why Hyperledger Fabric
Currently, most blockchain projects in NPOs are implemented on the permissionless blockchain, which has limited control
over the validators responsible for the authenticity of transactions. The Karma project demonstrates the novel approach
that implements permissioned blockchain technology on the public charity platform.

Hyperledger Fabric is considered one of the most distinguished permissioned blockchain implementations with a novel
architecture explicitly developed to create enterprise-grade applications.

Hyperledger Fabric-based networks are managed by a consortium of organizations that determines the network
configuration, the basic rules for the interaction of organizations, and adding new organizations, excluding existing
ones.

## Why it can be trusted
A trusted set of validators endorses all operations within the Karma platform, validates the contents of the
transactions, and keeps copies of the shared log with all transaction records.

Therefore, all activities and operations of charitable organizations become public and can be easily verified. Besides,
the donor can check the entire track of donated funds, from the initial source to the target group which builds trust
and increase the donor’s reliance on the integrity of the charity organization.

The platform is developed based on open-source libraries. Business logic is embedded and encapsulated in auditable smart
contracts distributed among validating nodes belonging to platform validators. Since all validators are independent and
decentralized, interacting according to the Byzantine and fault-tolerant consensus algorithm, and the state is contained
in an immutable distributed ledger, participants can be confident in the system’s integrity.
